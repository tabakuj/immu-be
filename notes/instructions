We would like to invite you to the next step, a home assignment, which will be used to assess the quality of your code and your skill level. Please find the instructions below:

Please have a look at our cloud service immudb Vault and build a simple application (Backend + Frontend) around it with the following requirements:
Application is storing accounting information within immudb Vault with the following structure: account number (unique), account name, iban, address, amount, type (sending, receiving)
Application has an API to add and retrieve accounting information
Application has a frontend that displays accounting information and allows to create new records.
The solution should:
Have a readme
Have a documented API ** TODO ask about this? what do they mean
Have docker-compose so it is easy to run.
Resources:

immudb Vault documentation: https://vault.immudb.io/docs/
API reference: https://vault.immudb.io/docs/api/v1

If you have any questions, feel free to refer to Dennis or Adam (cc).

Please let us know once you can estimate when you will be ready (typically doable within one week, max. deadline is 2 weeks).

Kindly send us your solution by email or share it as a GitHub repository so that we can review it before.
